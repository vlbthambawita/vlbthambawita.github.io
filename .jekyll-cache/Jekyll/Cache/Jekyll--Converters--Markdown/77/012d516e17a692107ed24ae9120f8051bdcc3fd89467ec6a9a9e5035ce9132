I"<p>In this paper, we analyse two deep learning methods to predict sperm motility and sperm morphology from sperm videos. We use two different inputs: stacked pure frames of videos and dense optical flows of video frames. To solve this regression task of predicting motility and morphology, stacked dense optical flows and extracted original frames from sperm videos were used with the modified state of the art convolution neural networks. For modifications of the selected models, we have introduced an additional multi-layer perceptron to overcome the problem of over-fitting. The method which had an additional multi-layer perceptron with dropout layers, shows the best results when the inputs consist of both dense optical flows and an original frame of videos.</p>
