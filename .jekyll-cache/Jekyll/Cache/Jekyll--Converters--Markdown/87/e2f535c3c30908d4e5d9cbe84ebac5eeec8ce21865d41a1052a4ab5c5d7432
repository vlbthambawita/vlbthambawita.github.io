I"ó<p>Automated disease detection in videos and images from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has received much attention in the last years. However, the quality of image data is often reduced due to overlays of text and positional data. In this paper, we present different methods of preprocessing such images and we describe our approach to GI disease classification for the Kvasir v2 dataset. We propose multiple approaches to inpaint problematic areas in the images to improve the anomaly classification, and we discuss the effect that such preprocessing does to the input data. In short, our experiments show that the proposed methods improve the Matthews correlation coefficient by approximately 7% in terms of better classification of GI anomalies.</p>
