In this paper, we present our approach for the 2018 Medico Task classifying diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. We have proposed a system based on global features and deep neural networks. The best approach combines two neural networks, and the reproducible experimental results signify the efficiency of the proposed model with an accuracy rate of 95.80%, a precision of 95.87%, and an F1-score of 95.80%
