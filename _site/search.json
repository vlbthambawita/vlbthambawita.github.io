      "content": "String matching is an important part in today’s computer applications and Aho-Corasick algorithm is one of the main string matching algorithms used to accomplish this. This paper discusses that when can the GPUs be used for string matching applications using the Aho-Corasick algorithm as a benchmark We have to identify the best unit to run our string matching algorithm according to the performance of our devices and the applications. Sometimes CPU gives better performance than GPU and sometimes GPU gives better performance than CPU. Therefore, identifying this critical point is significant task for researchers who are using GPUs to improve the performance of their string matching applications based on string matching algorithms.Citation:@INPROCEEDINGS{7069585,  author={Thambawita, D.

      "content": "The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a multiple patterns searching algorithm running sequentially in various applications like network intrusion detection and bioinformatics for finding several input strings within a given large input string. The parallel version of the Aho-Corasick algorithm is called as Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm because it doesnt need failure links like in the original Aho-Corasick algorithm. In this research, we implemented an application specific parallel failureless Aho-Corasick algorithm on the general purpose graphic processing unit by applying several cache optimization techniques for matching DNA sequences. Our parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm shows better performance than the available parallel Aho-Corasick algorithm library due to its simplicity and optimized cache memory usage of graphic processing units for matching DNA sequences."

      "content": "General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit(GPGPU) is used widely for achieving high performance or high throughput in parallel programming. This capability of GPGPUs is very famous in the new era and mostly used for scientific computing which requires more processing power than normal personal computers. Therefore, most of the programmers, researchers and industry use this new concept for their work. However, achieving high-performance or high-throughput using GPGPUs are not an easy task compared with conventional programming concepts in the CPU side. In this research, the CPUs cache memory optimization techniques have been adopted to the GPGPUs cache memory to identify rare performance improvement techniques compared to GPGPU’s best practices. The cache optimization techniques of blocking, loop fusion, array merging and array transpose were tested on GPGPUs for finding suitability of these techniques. Finally, we identified that some of the CPU cache optimization techniques go well with the cache memory system of the GPGPU and shows performance improvements while some others show the opposite effect on the GPGPUs compared with the CPUs."

In this paper, we present different methods of preprocessing such images and we describe our approach to GI disease classification for the Kvasir v2 dataset. We propose multiple approaches to inpaint problematic areas in the images to improve the anomaly classification, and we discuss the effect that such preprocessing does to the input data. In short, our experiments show that the proposed methods improve the Matthews correlation coefficient by approximately 7% in terms of better classification of GI anomalies."

      "content": "Deep learning (DL) is one of the standard methods in the field of multimedia research to perform data classification, detection, segmentation and generation. Within DL, generative adversarial networks (GANs) represents a new and highly popular branch of methods. GANs have the capability to generate, from random noise or conditional input, new data realizations within the dataset population. While generation is popular and highly useful in itself, GANs can also be useful to improve supervised DL. GAN-based approaches can, for example, perform segmentation or create synthetic data for training other DL models. The latter one is especially interesting in domains where not much training data exists such as medical multimedia. In this respect, performing a series of experiments involving GANs can be very time consuming due to the lack of tools that support the whole pipeline such as structured training, testing and tracking of different architectures and configurations. Moreover, the success of generative models is highly dependent on hyper-parameter optimization and statistical analysis in the design and fine-tuning stages. In this paper, we present a new tool called GANEx for making the whole pipeline of training, inference and benchmarking GANs faster, more efficient and more structured. The tool consists of a special library called FastGAN which allows designing generative models very fast. Moreover, GANEx has a graphical user interface to support structured experimenting, quick hyper-parameter configurations and output analysis. The presented tool is not limited to a specific DL framework and can be therefore even used to compare the performance of cross frameworks."

      "content": "Methods for automatic analysis of clinical data are usually targeted towards a specific modality and do not make use of all relevant data available. In the field of male human reproduction, clinical and biological data are not used to its fullest potential. Manual evaluation of a semen sample using a microscope is time-consuming and requires extensive training. Furthermore, the validity of manual semen analysis has been questioned due to limited reproducibility, and often high inter-personnel variation. The existing computer-aided sperm analyzer systems are not recommended for routine clinical use due to methodological challenges caused by the consistency of the semen sample. Thus, there is a need for an improved methodology. We use modern and classical machine learning techniques together with a dataset consisting of 85 videos of human semen samples and related participant data to automatically predict sperm motility. Used techniques include simple linear regression and more sophisticated methods using convolutional neural networks. Our results indicate that sperm motility prediction based on deep learning using sperm motility videos is rapid to perform and consistent. Adding participant data did not improve the algorithms performance. In conclusion, machine learning-based automatic analysis may become a valuable tool in male infertility investigation and research."

We use two different inputs: stacked pure frames of videos and dense optical flows of video frames. To solve this regression task of predicting motility and morphology, stacked dense optical flows and extracted original frames from sperm videos were used with the modified state of the art convolution neural networks. For modifications of the selected models, we have introduced an additional multi-layer perceptron to overcome the problem of over-fitting. The method which had an additional multi-layer perceptron with dropout layers, shows the best results when the inputs consist of both dense optical flows and an original frame of videos."

First, we use an autoencoder to extract temporal features from a given semen video and plot these into image-space, which we call feature-images. Second, these feature-images are used to perform transfer learning to predict the motility and morphology values of human sperm. The presented method shows it’s capability to extract temporal information into spatial domain feature-images which can be used with traditional convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, the accuracy of the predicted motility of a given semen sample shows that a deep learning-based model can capture the temporal information of microscopic recordings of human semen."

Such movement data can predict certain health states or performance outcomes. However, in order to increase reliability and replication of the research, it is important to share data and results openly. In medicine, this is often difficult due to legal restrictions or to the fact that data collected from clinical trials is seen as very valuable and something that should be kept “in-house”. In this paper, we therefore present PSYKOSE, a publicly shared dataset consisting of motor activity data collected from body sensors. The dataset contains data collected from patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, as well as symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and diminished motivation. In total, we have data from 22 patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy control persons. For each person in the dataset, we provide sensor data collected over several days in a row. In addition to the sensor data, we also provide some demographic data and medical assessments during the observation period. The patients were assessed by medical experts from Haukeland University hospital. In addition to the data, we provide a baseline analysis and possible use-cases of the dataset."

      "content": "Precise and efficient automated identification of gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases can help doctors treat more patients and improve the rate of disease detection and identification. Currently, automatic analysis of diseases in the GI tract is a hot topic in both computer science and medical-related journals. Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete or simply wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets, and cross-dataset evaluations are rarely performed. A clear understanding of evaluation metrics and machine learning models with cross datasets is crucial to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Toward this goal, we present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models using global features and deep neural networks that can classify 16 different key types of GI tract conditions, including pathological findings, anatomical landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal findings from images captured by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we introduce performance hexagons using six performance metrics, such as recall, precision, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and the Matthews correlation coefficient to demonstrate how to determine the real capabilities of models rather than evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset evaluations using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset evaluations, we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable model that could be used across different hospitals. Our experiments clearly show that more sophisticated performance metrics and evaluation methods need to be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations of the splits of the same dataset—that is, the performance metrics should always be interpreted together rather than relying on a single metric."

However, medical data is often sparse and hard to obtain due to legal restrictions and lack of medical personnel for the cumbersome and tedious process to manually label training data. These constraints make it difficult to develop systems for automatic analysis, like detecting disease or other lesions. In this respect, this article presents HyperKvasir, the largest image and video dataset of the gastrointestinal tract available today. the data is collected during real gastro- and colonoscopy examinations at Bærum Hospital in Norway and partly labeled by experienced gastrointestinal endoscopists. The dataset contains 110,079 images and 374 videos, and represents anatomical landmarks as well as pathological and normal findings. The total number of images and video frames together is around 1 million. Initial experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis systems. The HyperKvasir dataset can play a valuable role in developing better algorithms and computer-assisted examination systems not only for gastro- and colonoscopy, but also for other fields in medicine."
